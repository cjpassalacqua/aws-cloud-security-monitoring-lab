#AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Lab

This project demonstrates a foundational AWS security monitoring environment designed to simulate real-world cloud security operations. It includes identity hardening, centralized logging, CLI-based management, and preparation for threat detection and compliance scanning using AWS native tools.

#Objectives

Establish secure AWS administration using IAM, MFA, and least privilege.
Configure centralized, auditable logging with CloudTrail + S3.
Prepare AWS-native threat detection tools (GuardDuty, Security Hub).
Use AWS CLI to automate setup and validate configuration.
Document architecture and controls to mirror actual cloud security workflows.
#Services Used

IAM – MFA, admin user, secure root governance
CloudTrail – API activity logging across the account
S3 – Encrypted bucket for log storage
AWS CLI – Terminal-based configuration and automation
GuardDuty
Security Hub
IAM Access Analyzer
