#AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Lab

This project demonstrates a foundational AWS security monitoring environment designed to simulate real-world cloud security operations. It includes identity hardening, centralized logging, CLI-based management, and preparation for threat detection and compliance scanning using AWS native tools.

--
#Objectives

Establish secure AWS administration using IAM, MFA, and least privilege.
Configure centralized, auditable logging with CloudTrail + S3.
Prepare AWS-native threat detection tools (GuardDuty, Security Hub).
Use AWS CLI to automate setup and validate configuration.
Document architecture and controls to mirror actual cloud security workflows.

--
#Services Used

IAM – MFA, admin user, secure root governance
CloudTrail – API activity logging across the account
S3 – Encrypted bucket for log storage
AWS CLI – Terminal-based configuration and automation
GuardDuty
Security Hub
IAM Access Analyzer

--
#Key Features

Strong identity security through IAM admin user + enforced MFA.
Root account locked down and converted to emergency-only use.
CloudTrail trail created via AWS CLI with a secure bucket policy.
Logs stored privately with bucket-owner-only permissions.
CLI verified with aws sts get-caller-identity.
Environment structured to support SOC-style monitoring once GuardDuty/Security Hub are activated.

#About This Project

This is part of my cloud security portfolio as I transition into Cloud Security Support and AWS security roles. The project mirrors how security teams set up foundational visibility, identity hardening, and threat detection pipelines in a new AWS environment.
